# Predict_Coronary_Heart_Disease
Capstone Project for the Flatiron School Data Science Bootcamp Immersive Program

## Motivation:
The motivation for this project was to indentify certain health, lifestyle, and nutrition related questions that could be asked in a non-clinical setting (examples: website, mobile apps) to identify if someone could be at risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). The application could be for pharmaceutical/healthcare companies to identify target audience to include in a disease awareness program - CRM emails or targeted digital advertising.
